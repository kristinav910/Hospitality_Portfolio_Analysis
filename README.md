# Portfolio Analysis
Unit_4_Homework

### Whale Portfolio Analysis
1. Used Pandas to read multiple CSV files. Concatenated files into one data frame to analyze risk, Sharpe ratios & Beta in comparison to S&P 500 
2. Used Google Finance to gather data on three other stock tickers from same time frame. Analyzed Starbucks, Marriott & Hilton. Created an equally weighted portfolio to identify daily returns from these picks. 
3. Concatenated this Custom portfolio into the original data frame and reassessed all the data together. Some data outputs changed in original data because the time frame was shortened - original spanned multiple years, where new portfolio was for May 2018 - May 2019. 

*Note - ran into ambiguity errors with finding the Beta for the last task, and is still unresolved*
